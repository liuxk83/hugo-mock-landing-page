# hugo-mock-landing-page

This repo contains a [landing page](https://liuxk83.github.io/hugo-mock-landing-page/) for FlavorForge, an (imaginary) product that 3D-prints delicious meals.
Made using the static site generator Hugo and [Felipe Carneiro's Bootstrap theme](https://github.com/filipecarneiro/hugo-bootstrap-theme).
