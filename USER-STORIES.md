# User Stories for FlavorForge

This is a backlog of user stories for FlavorForge, a tool for 3D-printing delicious meals.

## Current Features

These are features that are currently implemented in FlavorForge, and which feature on the landing page.

### Illustrated Features

1. As a user, I want to save my dietary preferences to my personal profile and receive recipe recommendations accordingly, so I can easily access new recipes that fit my preferences.
2. As a user, I want to view and save nutritional info for each meal to my personal profile, so I can meet my dietary goals every day without having to manually track my intake. 
3. As a user, I want to review/rate certain recipes and see others’ reviews/ratings, so I have a better idea about which recipes are more popular.

### Other Features

1. As a user with dietary needs, I want to see tags (vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.) associated with each meal, so I can make sure to choose the meals that fit my dietary needs.
2. As a chef, I want to create my own printing-compatible recipes and upload them publicly, so other users can try them out and give feedback.
3. As a user, I want to control the printer from a phone/tablet app, so I can make meals without having to be physically beside the printer itself.
4. As a user, I want to be receive a notification when my meal is ready, so I know when to retrieve it from the printer. (_Note: We combined this user story with the previous one._)

## Potential Features Expansion

1. As a user, I want to access key information about unused ingredients (e.g., amount left, expiration date), so I can plan which ingredients to prioritize and which to order soon.
2. As a user, I want to have the option to automatically wash the printer’s components after each meal, so I do not need to manually wash them.
3. As an elderly/disabled user, I want to customize food texture or choose meals with softer textures, so I can easily enjoy good meals that fit accommodate my issues with chewing/swallowing.
4. As a doctor, I want to see what my patients are eating (with their permission), so I can monitor their nutritional intake.
5. As a busy user, I want to save certain recipes as favorites, so I can make my favorite meals more quickly.
6. As a user, I want to have a clear tutorial on how to use the printer, so I can quickly learn the most important parts of the printer.
7. As a user, I want to have compatible ingredient kits recommended to me and available for sale on the app, so I can easily order kits I want and load them into the printer.
8. As a producer/restaurant, I want to provide my own signature kits/recipes through partnerships, so users can still get food from me in cases where ordering is not practical.
9. As a user, I want to share recipes or lists of recipes with other users (but not publicly), so my close friends can see what kinds of meals I have been making.
10. As a user, I want to access key information about unused ingredients (e.g., amount left, expiration date), so I can plan which ingredients to prioritize and which to order soon.
